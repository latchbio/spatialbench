Which pattern best matches the clustering computed from this dataset?\n\nA) Astro-2 cells are evenly scattered across multiple astrocyte clusters with no clear enrichment in any one cluster.\nB) Astro-2 cells are enriched in a single dominant astrocyte cluster that is transcriptionally distinct from Astro-1.\nC) Astro-2 cells are confined to a small astrocyte–microglia interface cluster that co-expresses strong microglial markers.\nD) Astro-2 cells split into two similarly sized clusters, one enriched in juvenile animals and the other in old animals.\n\nReturn EXACTLY: <EVAL_ANSWER>{\"answer\": \"<letter>\"}</EVAL_ANSWER>.",

  "notes": "From Fig 2B–C. Astro-2 is an aging-associated astrocyte state enriched in old animals and upregulates inflammatory/aging markers such as Gfap and C4b. This distinct age- and gene-program profile leads to a dominant Astro-2–enriched cluster that is clearly separated from baseline astrocyte states like Astro-1, rather than being evenly scattered or split into juvenile vs old subclusters.",
